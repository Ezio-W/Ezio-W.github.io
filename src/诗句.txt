
Chapter One
We have lost even this twilight.
No one saw us this evening hand in hand.
while the blue night dropped on the world.
    我们甚至失去了今日的黄昏
    当湛蓝的暮色跌落在世上
    无人顾及我们双手相牵
I have seen from my window
the fiesta of sunset in the distant mountain tops.
    窗中 我瞧见
    远方山边落日下的祭典

Chapter Two
Sometimes a piece of sun
burned like a coin in my hand.
    有时 太阳的一缕焰色
    侵染了手中的硬币
I remembered you with my soul clenched
in that sadness of mine that you know.
    在那片你熟悉的哀伤里
    我想起你 与紧握住的灵魂
Where were you then?
Who else was there?
Saying what?
Why will the whole of love come on me suddenly
when I am sad and feel you are far away?
    彼时 你在何处？
    又何人？
    又何言？
    为何在我沉郁而你远去之时
    我却感到深沉的爱意将自己俘获？

Chapter Three
The book fell that always closed at twilight
and my blue sweater rolled like a hurt dog at my feet.
    书本总是在黄昏时滑落闭合
    蓝毛衫像小狗一般蜷缩在脚边
Always, always you recede through the evenings
toward the twilight erasing statues.
    你总是借着暮色隐没
    背影消逝在那抹余晖里
